The policyholder’s yearly premium is estimated through the use of medical insurance cost projection.Numerous variables are considered, including age, gender, BMI, number of children, location and smoker.
Our proposed model also includes some more features:alcoholic, diabetes, heart disease, blood pressure, pre existing diseases and surgeries.The cost of insurance is predicted using these features.
Data collection and preprocessing: Gathering all pertinent information, such as patient demographics, medical history,lifestyle factors, and insurance details, is the initial step in the procedure. 
After that, the dataset is preprocessed to get rid of missing values, inconsistent values, and outliers. Tasks like imputation, normalization, and categorical variable encoding ensure the consistency and 
quality of the data and offer a solid foundation for future investigation.
Features Engineering:Feature engineering enhances the dataset’s predictive power by extracting insightful information from it. Techniques like dimensionality reduction (PCA) and feature selection
(mutual information, recursive feature deletion) are applied. This process enhances the insurance cost prediction dataset for model evaluation and training by identifying relevant parameters.
Model Selection and Training: The applicability of several machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and linear regression, is assessed. To effectively measure model performance, the dataset is partitioned
into training, validation, and testing sets. Cross-validation and other optimization techniques help to ensure robustness and generalizability of hyperparameters.

Testing: To test the predictive model with new customer data, preprocess the incoming data in accordance with the model’s specifications, use the trained model to forecast the costs of insurance for prospective 
clients, and, if available, compare the forecasts with the actual expenses incurred.Random forest algorithms and multiple linear regression are used to forecast the cost of insurance.Validation on holdout datasets
confirms that the model can generalize to new data, reliably forecasts insurance prices for prospective clients,and facilitates efficient risk assessment in the insurance sector.
